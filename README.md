🎞️✨ A Python tool that maps and aligns Bilibili danmaku (弹幕) comments to uncut or non-official video sources using audio fingerprinting and dynamic time warping (DTW).

This project solves the problem where Bilibili versions of anime or shows have edited/trimmed content, causing time desynchronization between danmaku and original video sources. By analyzing the audio tracks of both versions, this tool builds a time mapping to accurately shift each comment to its correct moment.
